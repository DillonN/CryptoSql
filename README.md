CryptoSql is a custom MySQL server that uses the Ethereum blockchain as storage backing. It is intended for **research use only**. **Any use, particularly in production or on a live network, is at your own risk**.

For motivation, results, and analysis see the **[report writeup](CryptoSQL-Writeup.pdf)**.
